## Description
- I built this application, so that I can easily access a digital notebook, a scratchpad, from anywhere with web access, not just on my local machine.
- This application will save you money in notepad costs; it solves the issue of easily losing your sticky notes, and it can be accessed away from home.
- Downfall of this application, is that the notes are not private and are available to anyone that uses the application.
- I learned how to properly set-up an Express.js server, get, post, delete, routes to files, how to access static folders and more.
